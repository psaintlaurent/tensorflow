This repository is composed of modified examples from the Tensorflow tutorials I'm using to explore ML using Tensorflow.
The authors expect that Jupyter notebook is going to be tool of choice.  I've modified these examples to work from CLI or pycharm IDE.
If the code doesn't look like production code its because this is tutorial code :-)

Nothing I do on this repository is a reflection or representation of my employer or any other institution other than
myself. These are all hobby projects.
